# 🐍 Python Tutorial Projects

This repository contains various Python files that I created while learning Python. Each script represents a step in my journey to mastering Python, ranging from basic concepts to more advanced topics.

## 🧠 What's Inside

- **basics/**: These files cover the very basics of Python, including variables, data types, and how to interact with users using `input()` and `print()`.
  
- **conditionals_loops/**: Files in this folder focus on control flow with **if/else** statements and loops (`for`, `while`). These are essential for creating dynamic programs.

- **functions/**: Here, I created examples for defining and using functions. This folder also explores **recursion** (where functions call themselves) and **lambda functions** for short, anonymous functions.

- **lists_dicts/**: Lists, dictionaries, and sets are core data structures in Python. These files demonstrate how to use and manipulate them in various ways.

- **file_handling/**: These files teach how to work with files — opening, reading, writing, and appending data to text files.

- **object_oriented/**: This is where I started learning **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**. It includes creating **classes**, adding **methods** and **attributes**, and using **inheritance**.
